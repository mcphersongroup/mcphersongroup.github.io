## Local Development

To work with this website locally:

2. Clone this repository
3. Run `quarto preview` to start a local development server
4. Edit the `.qmd` files to update content

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml`.

### Member Post Synchronization

The website automatically aggregates research posts from organization members' individual GitHub profiles. This is handled by:

- `.github/workflows/sync-member-posts.yml` - Runs daily to sync new posts
- `sync_member_posts.py` - Python script that performs the synchronization
- `members.yml` - Configuration defining active members

See [MEMBER_SYNC_DOCS.md](MEMBER_SYNC_DOCS.md) for detailed documentation.

## Customization

- Update content in the `.qmd` files
- Modify `styles.css` for custom styling
- Add new pages by creating additional `.qmd` files and updating the navigation in `_quarto.yml`
