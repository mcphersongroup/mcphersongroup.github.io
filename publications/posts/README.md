# Legacy Posts Directory

This directory previously contained research posts aggregated from organization members' individual GitHub profiles.

The sync system has been updated to sync publications from `USERNAME.github.io/publications` directly to the main `publications/` directory as individual publication folders containing `index.qmd` and associated image files.

This provides better organization and preserves the original publication structure including featured images.
