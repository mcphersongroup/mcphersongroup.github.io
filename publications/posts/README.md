# Research Posts in Publications Directory

This directory contains research posts aggregated from organization members' individual GitHub profiles.

Posts are automatically synced from member profiles at `USERNAME.github.io/research/posts` based on the member list defined in `members.yml`.

The posts are placed in the publications folder to consolidate all research outputs in one location.

## Structure

Each post maintains its original metadata and content while adding attribution to the original author and source.
