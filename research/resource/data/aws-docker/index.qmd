## Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Docker provide powerful cloud computing and containerization technologies for research. Together, they enable scalable, reproducible computational workflows that can run anywhere from a laptop to massive cloud infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Computing**: Access to virtually unlimited computing resources on AWS
- **Containerization**: Package applications with all dependencies using Docker
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent environments across different systems
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for resources used, scale up or down as needed
- **Multiple Services**: EC2, S3, Lambda, ECS, and more for diverse research needs
- **Version Control**: Track and share containerized workflows

## Use Cases in Research

- Running computationally intensive analyses (genomics, simulations, ML)
- Creating reproducible research environments
- Sharing analysis pipelines with collaborators
- Processing large datasets that exceed local computing capacity
- Deploying web applications for data visualization or collection
- Archiving data and results in cloud storage

## Getting Started

- AWS: Visit [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) to create an account and explore services
- Docker: Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com) and follow tutorials to learn containerization
